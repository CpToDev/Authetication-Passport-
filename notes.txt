Level 2 :security was to use mongoose-encryption
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { secret: process.env.SECRET, encryptedFields: ['password'] });

then simplpy on saving the password it will encrypt it and on finding it it will sim,ply decrypt it

Main reason of weakness is that if anyone gets the key they can easily decrypt it 

we used process.env.SECRET using dontenv package 

Level 3: using hashing md5 package which simply checks login password's hash value with the registered password's hash value 



using passport 

npm i passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose express-session
